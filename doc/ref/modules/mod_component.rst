This is an experimental module. It will be the basis of a new method of
loading *components* in HTML pages. Components consist of HTML, javascript,
and css. These parts can be dynamically loaded. Layout can/will be done
using *mithril.js*.

This module will undergo significant changes, so use at your own risk.
It is included to support some parties that use this in production.
