Introduction
============

This is the Zotonic Developer Guide. It takes you through all aspects of Zotonic
so you can start building your own sites as quickly as possible.

If you are an end user rather than developer, you may want to read the User
Guide instead.

An overview of Zotonic
----------------------

Zotonic is a complete stack for building advanced websites quickly. It consists
of:

1. a content management system (CMS)
2. a web framework
3. a web server.

You can rapidly develop CMS-based sites on top of Zotonic. If you need more
flexibility, you can customise all aspects of Zotonic. The included web server
means can start working with Zotonic right away, without the need for installing
Apache or Nginx separately.

Zotonic is structured into modules. Each module offers a specific piece of
functionality; the CMS is itself a module. There are modules for access control,
social media integration, TLS, video embeds and much more.

Central to Zotonic is its uniquely flexible data model.
